Best things to implement later are more recent fights carry more weight 
and to use the betting odds as a soft indecator

test train split takes data and looks at some amount usually 80 as the train.
the X values are used to predict the y values (like if x is stats and y is are they in hall of fame)
it uses the 80% of x and y to create a algorithm of does x lead to y. then tests it on the test 20%
to get the accuracy. Then can implement this in a random forest
can look at featur importances to see what is used more to determine outcomes


To create an algorithm that predicts the most likely UFC fight winner based on detailed statistics, we can use a machine learning classification approach. Here's a full breakdown of how to approach this problem, including:

Features to use

Data preprocessing

Algorithm selection

Model training

Evaluation strategy

üß† Step 1: Define the Features (Input Variables)
For each fighter in a matchup, use the following normalized features (per fighter):

Feature	Description
striking_accuracy	% of strikes that land
takedown_accuracy	% of takedowns that succeed
sig_strikes_landed_per_min	Aggressiveness metric
sig_strikes_absorbed_per_min	Damage received per minute
takedown_avg_per_15min	Grappling control metric
submission_avg_per_15min	Submission threat
sig_strike_defense	% of significant strikes avoided
takedown_defense	% of takedowns defended
knockdown_avg_per_15min	Power indicator
avg_fight_time	Durability/experience indicator
win_percent_tko	Finishing power (TKO%)
win_percent_sub	Finishing ability (Submission%)
win_percent_dec	Durability/cardio (Decision%)










üì¶ Step 2: Structure the Data
You'll create a dataset where each row represents a fight, and the features are a combination or difference between Fighter A and Fighter B.

python
Copy
Edit
features = [
    'striking_accuracy_diff',
    'takedown_accuracy_diff',
    'sig_strikes_landed_diff',
    'sig_strikes_absorbed_diff',
    'takedown_avg_diff',
    'submission_avg_diff',
    'sig_strike_defense_diff',
    'takedown_defense_diff',
    'knockdown_avg_diff',
    'avg_fight_time_diff',
    'win_percent_tko_diff',
    'win_percent_sub_diff',
    'win_percent_dec_diff',
]
For each fight:

python
Copy
Edit
feature_X_diff = fighterA_X - fighterB_X
Label (y): 1 if Fighter A won, 0 otherwise.










ü§ñ Step 3: Choose a Model
Recommended algorithms:

Logistic Regression (simple, interpretable)

Random Forest (handles nonlinearities, good accuracy)

XGBoost (state-of-the-art for tabular data)

Optionally: Neural Networks, if lots of data available

Example with Scikit-learn (Random Forest):

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# X = DataFrame with fight feature differences
# y = winner (1 = fighter A, 0 = fighter B)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")










üìà Step 4: Predict New Matchups
To predict the winner of a new fight:

Input stats for both fighters.

Compute feature differences.

Pass features to the trained model:

python
Copy
Edit
prediction = model.predict([feature_diff_vector])
winner = "Fighter A" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Fighter B"
üîç Optional Enhancements
Feature Engineering: Include ratios (e.g., strike ratio, takedown ratio).

Time-Based Weighting: Weigh recent fights more heavily.

Add Odds: Use Vegas betting odds as a soft prior.








‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements
To implement this in practice, you need:

Historical UFC fight data with stats (from sources like UFCStats.com)

A Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VSCode)

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

Would you like me to generate:

A Python script to run this end-to-end?

A mock dataset you can test it on?

An API-ready version you can plug into an app?

Let me know your goal.
